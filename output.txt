Ambulatory Network *cannot* sustain all injured.
To minimize loss of life, triage and use the following routes: 

Send 00036 Injured Along: South Bank -> ambulA -> Mt. Safety
Send 00004 Injured Along: South Bank -> ambulB -> North General
Send 00014 Injured Along: North Lake -> ambulD -> Large Hospice
